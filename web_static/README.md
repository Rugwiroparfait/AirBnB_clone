# Project: AirBnB Clone - Web Static

This project is a part of the SE Foundations curriculum and aims to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS. You'll be creating static web pages for an AirBnB clone step-by-step, focusing on the structure (HTML) and design (CSS) of the pages without any dynamic functionality or data loading.



## Background

In this project, you'll be working on developing the front end of an AirBnB clone incrementally. You'll start with simple HTML static pages and progressively add styling using CSS. Each task builds upon the previous one, helping you grasp the core concepts of HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Requirements

- All HTML files should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator.
- CSS files should follow specified requirements and be organized within the `styles` folder.
- No inline styling should be used except where explicitly mentioned in the tasks.
- JavaScript should not be used.
- Cross-browser compatibility is not required.
- Detailed task-specific requirements should be followed diligently.

## Tasks

This project consists of several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of HTML structure and CSS styling. The tasks include creating headers, footers, filter boxes, search buttons, and displaying results. Each task has specific layout requirements and constraints that you need to adhere to.

## Repository Structure

- **web_static/**
  - **styles/**
    - CSS files for each task (e.g., `2-common.css`, `2-header.css`)
  - HTML files for each task (e.g., `0-index.html`, `1-index.html`)
  - Image resources (if applicable)
